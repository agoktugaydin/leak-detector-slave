# ESPLeak v1

Explosions that occur as a result of flammable gas leaks in mines cause a lot of loss of life and property. With this project, it is aimed to prevent explosions in mines. A device has been designed to detect when there is a flammable gas leak in the environment, this device has been multiplexed by adding various features and it is aimed to create a mesh structure.

It is aimed to establish a mesh structure by placing the slave nodes at various points to be determined in the veins in the mine, and the master nodes at the vein separation points and the points where the authorities are located.

Slave devices can also be made into a device that miners can wear. 

In this project, the ESP-32 Development Module assumes the roles of communication and signal processing. Combustible gas and CO can be detected with the MQ-9 gas sensor on the device. Thanks to the data continuously transmitted from the slave devices to the master device, it is aimed to control the mine veins instantly and to get a quick reaction in the event of a crisis.
